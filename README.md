Using Google Colab, we develop a NMT, language translator. Here, we do NMT to translate from English to Vietnamese.  


Data was downloaded from the following link - 

```
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/  
````

In your Colab environment - choose runtime >> change_runtime_type >> choose GPU.

Once you download the data, just upload it in your gmail/google drive and share that "link" in the code to access the data. And the rest are good to go. 

Run the code.

The train funciton in program has no specific fucntion. Neglect it. 

In the same link you can also find English-Czech, English-German, and English-Vietnamese datasets too. Same code can be used to train them too. 

Accuracy obtained is pretty good. In general BLEU_score of 0.09+ is not bad. We have almost 0.25 which is pretty good to the extent of my knowledge.
